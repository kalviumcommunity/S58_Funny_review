# Tittle: Funny Restaurants Review

## Idea: The Funny Restaurants Review website aims to provide users with a platform to discover and share hilarious reviews of restaurants. Users can explore funny reviews posted by others or contribute their own amusing anecdotes after logging in. The project utilizes an API to fetch reviews from various restaurants and allows users to add their own reviews to be featured on the platform.

**Features**:

*  **Choose Any Restaurant**:  Users can select any restaurant from the available options.
* **Display Funny Reviews**:  The website displays a collection of funny reviews about the selected restaurant, sourced from an API.
* **Add Your Own Reviews**:  Logged-in users can submit their own funny reviews. These reviews are stored, reviewed, and then published to be featured on the website.
* **User Authentication**:  The website includes a login system to allow users to add their own reviews.
* **Review Moderation**:  Reviews submitted by users undergo a review process to ensure they meet the criteria of being funny before being published.
